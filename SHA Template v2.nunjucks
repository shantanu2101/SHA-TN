    <h4><strong>Jurisdiction</strong>||	This jurisdiction Clause confers two options: <strong>Option 1</strong> is an exclusive jurisdiction clause. The exclusive jurisdiction clause limits disputes to the courts of one jurisdiction. An exclusive jurisdiction Clause achieves relative certainty: you know where you can sue and be sued. However, there is a downside, in that if there is a change in circumstances the designated forum may no longer be a party's desired forum (for example if the counterparty no longer has assets in the jurisdiction, such that a judgment may not be readily enforceable and there is no reciprocal arrangement in place for the recognition and enforcement of judgments in the jurisdiction where the assets are located). <strong>Option 2</strong> is a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause. Non-exclusive jurisdiction clauses expressly provide for disputes to be heard in the courts of a particular jurisdiction without prejudice to the right of one or another of the parties to take a dispute to the court of any other jurisdiction if appropriate. Such clauses achieve certainty to the extent that the parties know that disputes can be heard in a particular jurisdiction but should proceedings in another jurisdiction be necessary, that flexibility of forum is available. However, although they offer greater flexibility there is the risk of parallel proceedings. Although the bringing of parallel proceedings in different jurisdictions will result in increased costs, there may be situations in which a party may want to have the option of bringing proceedings in different jurisdictions depending upon the location of the defendant's assets and the ease of enforcing foreign judgments in the relevant jurisdictions. Courts in some jurisdictions may try to avoid parallel proceedings.||</h4>

    <h4><strong>Counterparts</strong></h4>
        <h5>This Agreement may be executed and delivered in any number of counterparts, each of which is an original and all of which together evidence the same agreement.</h5>
        <h5>If this Agreement is subject to stamp duty and counterparts or duplicates of this Agreement are executed, [<em>insert</em>] [each Party] is entitled to retain and keep a fully stamped original of this Agreement and each other Party is entitled to retain and keep a fully stamped counterpart of this Agreement.</h5>
        <h5>This Agreement will not come into effect until each Party has executed and delivered to each other Party at least one duly executed counterpart. Upon such execution and delivery, this Agreement will become effective as against all Parties with effect from the Effective Date and in relation to the Specified Clauses, on the Agreement Date.</h5>
        <h5>This Agreement and counterparts of this Agreement may be delivered and exchanged electronically by exchange of pdf copies of the Agreement duly signed by each Party provided always that a Party exchanging a counterpart electronically shall provide each other Party with an original executed copy of the signature pages of the Agreement signed by it within [5 (five)] Business Days of exchange.||	Consider against local laws and whether there will be a face to face closing. May need to be considered against local law requirements for due execution and electronic execution of documents. Common practice in India is to exchange signature pages, however, in many jurisdictions this would not be recommended unless a full copy of the Agreement is also circulated with the signature page (in some jurisdictions such as England, there is significant case law around this). Failure to require circulation of the full Agreement with any signature page may open the way for debate around certainty of the Agreement (for instance, a Party may successfully argue that it did not intend to be bound by a particular version of the Agreement which the other Party argues is the final form). Where there is a remote signing and electronic exchange, circulating the full Agreement is therefore sometimes preferred. ||</h5>
    <h4><strong>Prohibition and severance</strong></h4>
        <h5>Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited in any jurisdiction is, in that jurisdiction, ineffective only to the extent of that prohibition.</h5>
        <h5>If a provision of this Agreement is illegal, void or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, that fact does not affect the legality, validity or enforceability of:</h5>
            <h6>the remaining provisions in that or any other jurisdiction; or</h6>
            <h6>that provision in any other jurisdiction.</h6>
        <h5>Any provision of this Agreement that is illegal, void or unenforceable may be severed from this Agreement and the remaining provisions continue in force unless this would materially change the intended effect of this Agreement in which case the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to agree to replacement or additional amendments to this Agreement which are reasonably necessary to maintain its intended effect and place the Parties in the position they would have been in (insofar as possible) had the original provision been legal, valid and enforceable.</h5>
    <h4><strong>Authorised signatories and attorneys</strong></h4>
        <h5>Each Person who executes this Agreement on behalf of a Party as an authorised signatory or under a power of attorney declares that they are not aware of any fact or circumstance that might affect their authority to do so.</h5>

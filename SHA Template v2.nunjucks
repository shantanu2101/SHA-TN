    <h2><b>Jurisdiction</b>||	This jurisdiction Clause confers two options: <b>Option 1</b> is an exclusive jurisdiction clause. The exclusive jurisdiction clause limits disputes to the courts of one jurisdiction. An exclusive jurisdiction Clause achieves relative certainty: you know where you can sue and be sued. However, there is a downside, in that if there is a change in circumstances the designated forum may no longer be a party's desired forum (for example if the counterparty no longer has assets in the jurisdiction, such that a judgment may not be readily enforceable and there is no reciprocal arrangement in place for the recognition and enforcement of judgments in the jurisdiction where the assets are located). <b>Option 2</b> is a non-exclusive jurisdiction clause. Non-exclusive jurisdiction clauses expressly provide for disputes to be heard in the courts of a particular jurisdiction without prejudice to the right of one or another of the parties to take a dispute to the court of any other jurisdiction if appropriate. Such clauses achieve certainty to the extent that the parties know that disputes can be heard in a particular jurisdiction but should proceedings in another jurisdiction be necessary, that flexibility of forum is available. However, although they offer greater flexibility there is the risk of parallel proceedings. Although the bringing of parallel proceedings in different jurisdictions will result in increased costs, there may be situations in which a party may want to have the option of bringing proceedings in different jurisdictions depending upon the location of the defendant's assets and the ease of enforcing foreign judgments in the relevant jurisdictions. Courts in some jurisdictions may try to avoid parallel proceedings.||</h2>

Use these options alternatively. Consider also whether it is appropriate to include such provisions dealing with the consequences of a Deadlock situation. It may be better for the agreement to be silent on this point, to avoid a party creating a Deadlock situation which it can then exploit/gaming the situation. This should be balanced against the desire for certainty.||
</div>
<p>
    <strong>[<em>Option 1: Auction/Shoot‑out</em>]|| This is an option where each Shareholder gives a sealed bid to the other Shareholder constituting (i) an offer to buy all the Shares held by the other Shareholder at the price written in its sealed bid if this is greater than the bid price specified by the other Shareholder in its sealed bid and (ii) an offer to sell all of its own Shares at the bid price specified by the other Shareholder in its sealed bid if that bid price exceeds its own. This tends to favour the more cash rich Shareholder who can afford to offer more for the other Shareholder's Shares.||

<p>If the Deadlock Matter is not resolved by the Deadlock Shareholder Representatives within the Deadlock Resolution Period, then any Deadlock Shareholder may within [30 (thirty)] Business Days after the expiry of the Deadlock Resolution Period serve a written notice (a <strong>Deadlock Resolution Notice</strong>) on the other Deadlock Shareholder(s).</p>
